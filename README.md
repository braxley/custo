This page is designed for you to decide what you'd like to watch. In this search you can look for movies that are above your rating threshold **without showing you the rating**. This helps you to **watch movies that are worth your time** with less expectations in terms of their quality. This rating is currently the one from **[IMDb](https://www.imdb.com)**.

When you are logged in, you can also **add the movies** of the search to your movies, so that you can use Custo to save movies that you'd like to watch later.

When your friends are also signed up, you can add them to find common movies that you can **watch together**!
