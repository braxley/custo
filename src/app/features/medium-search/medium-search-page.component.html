      This page is designed for you to decide what you'd like to watch. In this
      search you can look for movies that are above your rating threshold
      <strong>without showing you the rating</strong>. This helps you to
      <strong>watch movies that are worth your time</strong> with less
      expectations in terms of their quality. This rating is currently the one
      from <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDb</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are logged in, you can also <strong>add the movies</strong> of
      the search to your movies, so that you can use Custo to save movies that
      you'd like to watch later.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your friends are also signed up, you can add them to find common
      movies that you can <strong>watch together</strong>!
